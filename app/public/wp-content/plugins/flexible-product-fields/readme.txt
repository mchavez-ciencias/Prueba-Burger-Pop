The plugin extends the product options with extra fields. It allows customers to configure the product using texts, numbers, dropdowns and multi-dropdowns, radio buttons and checkboxes.

== Description ==

The Flexible Product Fields plugin extends WooCommerce product options with additional fields. It is a product configurator that allows Users to set a product tailored to their needs. Creating additional WooCommerce product fields in the management panel is very simple and gives a lot of options when making changes.

#### Some examples of using FPF fields

* Text fields for entering prints on T-shirts or engraving
* Select field with available sizes
* Radio field with colors to choose from
* Checkbox with an additional service such as gift wrapping or insurance
* and other...

#### Areas where FPF fields are shown

WooCommerce custom product fields are visible on the product page in the area above or below the Add to Cart button *(depending on the settings)*.

WooCommerce product addons will also appear on the Cart and Checkout page *(as a summary)* (the fields cannot be edited there) and in the dashboard in the Order Details.
